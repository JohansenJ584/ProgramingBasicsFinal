Spotify Art and Crowd
======================
Justin Johansen
Avery McMurtry

We created an application that creates an art piece based on the characterics of a song.
We do this by utilizing the Spotify web api and express to create an art web application.
The Spotify web api is used to login into a user's account then search through Spotify 
database for a user defined song then return characters of said song. Express on the other
hand is a node.js is a npm web application framework. This allows us to more easily communicate with
the Spotify web api. Now to the actual art creation part of the application. We use Characteristics from 
the song to decide 5 different aspects of the program. The line veracity of the top and bottom line,
the color that is filled in below the lines And finally if there is a crowd or not in the scene this is
based on the liveness characteristic.
